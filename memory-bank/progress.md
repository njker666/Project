# Urban Drive Development Progress

## Step 1: Project Structure Setup (Completed)

Date: [Current Date]

### What was accomplished:
- Created the main project directory `urban-drive`
- Created three main subdirectories:
  - `client` - For front-end code
  - `server` - For back-end code
  - `shared` - For code shared between client and server
- Created client subdirectories:
  - `rendering` - For Three.js scene rendering
  - `ui` - For user interface components
  - `physics` - For vehicle physics implementation
- Created server subdirectories:
  - `network` - For WebSocket implementation
  - `game-state` - For server-side game logic
- Created `config.js` in the shared directory with:
  - Game constants (max players, tick rate)
  - Performance targets (FPS, latency)
  - Vehicle physics parameters
  - Network settings
  - World size and layout constants
  - Traffic system configurations
  - Debug settings

### Challenges and Solutions:
- Adapted directory creation commands to PowerShell syntax
- Created each directory individually to ensure proper structure

### Validation:
- Verified the directory structure using `Get-ChildItem -Path urban-drive -Recurse`
- Confirmed the config.js file is properly created with the required constants

## Step 2: Development Environment Setup (Completed)

Date: [Current Date]

### What was accomplished:
- Created `package.json` with project metadata and dependencies
- Installed required libraries:
  - Three.js for 3D rendering
  - Express for the server
  - WebSocket (ws) for real-time communication
  - Parcel for bundling
  - Oimo.js for physics simulation
- Created client HTML file with a canvas element and FPS counter
- Added a simple client JavaScript file for testing
- Created a basic Express server to serve static files
- Set up npm scripts for development and production

### Challenges and Solutions:
- Addressed Parcel bundler issues by setting up a proper Express server
- Fixed module import issues by adding type="module" to script tag
- Created a simplified script structure to focus on core functionality

### Validation:
- Verified that the server starts correctly
- Confirmed access to the application via http://localhost:3000
- Checked that the FPS counter works and updates

## Step 3: Basic 3D Scene Creation (Completed)

Date: [Current Date]

### What was accomplished:
- Created a `scene.js` file in the `client/rendering` directory
- Implemented a Scene class with THREE.js to encapsulate scene management
- Set up core Three.js components:
  - Scene with sky blue background and fog for distance
  - Perspective camera positioned to view the ground
  - WebGL renderer with shadow support
  - Lighting (ambient and directional) for proper illumination
  - Large flat ground plane (1000x1000 units) with green material
- Added window resize handler for responsive canvas sizing
- Integrated FPS counter into the animation loop
- Modified index.js to use the new Scene class
- Updated server.js to properly serve ES modules
- Added Three.js import through CDN using import maps

### Challenges and Solutions:
- Solved ES module import issues by using import maps and CDN for Three.js
- Added middleware in the Express server to set proper MIME types
- Created a class-based architecture for better organization and future extensibility

### Validation:
- Verified the 3D scene renders a green ground plane and blue sky
- Confirmed the camera is positioned correctly to view the scene
- Checked that the FPS counter maintains at least 30 FPS
- Tested window resizing to ensure the scene remains responsive

## Step 4: Basic Keyboard Controls Implementation (Completed)

Date: [Current Date]

### What was accomplished:
- Created a `controls.js` file in the client directory
- Implemented a Controls class to handle keyboard input
- Set up event listeners for keydown and keyup events
- Added support for the following controls:
  - Arrow keys and WASD for movement (up/down/left/right)
  - Spacebar for handbrake
  - Additional keys for horn (H), camera toggle (C), and indicators (Q, E)
- Implemented console logging of control state with throttling to avoid spam
- Added visual UI indicators to display current control state on screen
- Updated index.js to use the Controls class and update visual indicators
- Integrated controls with the game loop

### Challenges and Solutions:
- Implemented throttling for console logs to prevent console spam
- Added visual indicators for control state for easier testing
- Designed the Controls class to be extensible for future input methods
- Organized code with a proper class structure and encapsulation

### Validation:
- Verified that all control keys are detected correctly
- Confirmed console logs show the current control state
- Tested visual indicators to ensure they reflect the current control state
- Checked that both arrow keys and WASD work for movement controls

## Step 5: Simple Player Vehicle with Physics (Completed)

Date: [Current Date]

### What was accomplished:
- Created a `vehicle.js` file in the `client/physics` directory
- Implemented a Vehicle class with Three.js and Oimo.js integration
- Created a visually appealing vehicle model with:
  - Main car body with slightly rounded edges
  - Four wheels positioned at the corners
  - Windshield with transparent material
  - Headlights with emissive material
- Implemented physics-based vehicle movement:
  - Acceleration and braking with realistic parameters
  - Steering that accounts for vehicle speed
  - Handbrake functionality with drift effects
  - Wheel rotation based on vehicle speed
- Added camera follow functionality to track the vehicle
- Created a speed display indicator that changes color based on speed
- Updated the Scene class to support camera targeting
- Added ES module wrapper for Oimo.js to support imports

### Challenges and Solutions:
- Implemented custom physics model using Oimo.js
- Created smooth camera following with position interpolation
- Balanced vehicle physics parameters for responsive but realistic controls
- Added the necessary CDN and module wrapper for Oimo.js

### Validation:
- Verified that the vehicle appears on the ground plane
- Confirmed that the vehicle responds to keyboard controls
- Tested acceleration, braking, and steering with physics-based movement
- Verified that the camera follows the vehicle smoothly
- Checked that the speed display updates correctly and changes color

### Next Steps:
- Proceed to Step 6: Create a diverse city layout with districts
- Implement multiple distinct areas with different building types
