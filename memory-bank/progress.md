# Urban Drive Development Progress

## Step 1: Project Structure Setup (Completed)

Date: [Current Date]

### What was accomplished:
- Created the main project directory `urban-drive`
- Created three main subdirectories:
  - `client` - For front-end code
  - `server` - For back-end code
  - `shared` - For code shared between client and server
- Created client subdirectories:
  - `rendering` - For Three.js scene rendering
  - `ui` - For user interface components
  - `physics` - For vehicle physics implementation
- Created server subdirectories:
  - `network` - For WebSocket implementation
  - `game-state` - For server-side game logic
- Created `config.js` in the shared directory with:
  - Game constants (max players, tick rate)
  - Performance targets (FPS, latency)
  - Vehicle physics parameters
  - Network settings
  - World size and layout constants
  - Traffic system configurations
  - Debug settings

### Challenges and Solutions:
- Adapted directory creation commands to PowerShell syntax
- Created each directory individually to ensure proper structure

### Validation:
- Verified the directory structure using `Get-ChildItem -Path urban-drive -Recurse`
- Confirmed the config.js file is properly created with the required constants

## Step 2: Development Environment Setup (Completed)

Date: [Current Date]

### What was accomplished:
- Created `package.json` with project metadata and dependencies
- Installed required libraries:
  - Three.js for 3D rendering
  - Express for the server
  - WebSocket (ws) for real-time communication
  - Parcel for bundling
  - Oimo.js for physics simulation
- Created client HTML file with a canvas element and FPS counter
- Added a simple client JavaScript file for testing
- Created a basic Express server to serve static files
- Set up npm scripts for development and production

### Challenges and Solutions:
- Addressed Parcel bundler issues by setting up a proper Express server
- Fixed module import issues by adding type="module" to script tag
- Created a simplified script structure to focus on core functionality

### Validation:
- Verified that the server starts correctly
- Confirmed access to the application via http://localhost:3000
- Checked that the FPS counter works and updates

## Step 3: Basic 3D Scene Creation (Completed)

Date: [Current Date]

### What was accomplished:
- Created a `scene.js` file in the `client/rendering` directory
- Implemented a Scene class with THREE.js to encapsulate scene management
- Set up core Three.js components:
  - Scene with sky blue background and fog for distance
  - Perspective camera positioned to view the ground
  - WebGL renderer with shadow support
  - Lighting (ambient and directional) for proper illumination
  - Large flat ground plane (1000x1000 units) with green material
- Added window resize handler for responsive canvas sizing
- Integrated FPS counter into the animation loop
- Modified index.js to use the new Scene class
- Updated server.js to properly serve ES modules
- Added Three.js import through CDN using import maps

### Challenges and Solutions:
- Solved ES module import issues by using import maps and CDN for Three.js
- Added middleware in the Express server to set proper MIME types
- Created a class-based architecture for better organization and future extensibility

### Validation:
- Verified the 3D scene renders a green ground plane and blue sky
- Confirmed the camera is positioned correctly to view the scene
- Checked that the FPS counter maintains at least 30 FPS
- Tested window resizing to ensure the scene remains responsive

### Next Steps:
- Proceed to Step 4: Implement basic keyboard controls
- Begin handling user input for vehicle movement
