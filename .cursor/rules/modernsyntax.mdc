# Your rule content

Use modern ES6+ syntax (e.g., const/let instead of var, arrow functions where appropriate). Favor concise, readable code with clear variable names reflecting game entities (e.g., `playerVehicle`, `trafficLightState`). Include JSDoc comments for all major functions (e.g., /** @param {number} speed - Vehicle speed in mph */).
