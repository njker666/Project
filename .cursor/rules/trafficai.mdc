# Your rule content

Implement traffic AI with a finite state machine (e.g., states: moving, stopped, turning). Sync traffic light states across all clients via WebSocket every 2 seconds or on change. Use simple pathfinding (e.g., predefined lanes) rather than complex algorithms like A* to keep it lightweight. Cap active traffic vehicles at 50 per player viewport.
